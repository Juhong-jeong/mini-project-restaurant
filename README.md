# mini-project-restaurant
A mini project on restaurant billing system developed JAVA in third year of my engineering.

It has two modules :
1) Owner
2) Customer

The owner can add, delete, update the menu items and the customer can order food available in menu. 
A bill is also generated for customer which includes the total amount with GST.
